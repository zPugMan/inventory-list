# InventoryList

This application combines the results from two Square APIs: 
* CatalogAPI
* InventoryAPI

The result is a shopping list for purchasing items identified as out-of-stock or low in inventory. When a user is picking items at the supplier, items on the list can be crossed-off as shopped.
